# Backend Skills


Backend agents execute the actual tasks, so standard Agent Skills
(`SKILL.md` folders in the open format) are installed for backends.
`qwenaudio skill` is a branded entry point for the community-standard
[skills.sh](https://skills.sh) installer (`npx skills`): every command is a
1:1 passthrough, with one addition — installs target the backends that
actually exist on this machine (CLI detected) plus the currently configured
backend, instead of relying on skills.sh's own agent detection.

```bash
qwenaudio skill install <source> --skill <name>   # install to every backend
qwenaudio skill install <source> --list           # list skills in a source
qwenaudio skill list                              # list installed skills
qwenaudio skill remove <name>                     # remove a skill
qwenaudio skill update                            # update installed skills
```

Supported sources are whatever skills.sh supports:

| Source form | Example |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub shorthand | `qwenaudio skill install vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill web-design-guidelines` |
| Repository URL (GitHub/GitLab/any git) | `qwenaudio skill install https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills --skill skill-security-auditor` |
| Tree URL (skill subdirectory) | `qwenaudio skill install https://github.com/o/r/tree/main/skills/x --skill x` |
| Hub skill page URL | `qwenaudio skill install https://clawhub.ai/thcjp/skills/excel-formula-tool-free --skill excel-formula-tool-free` |
| Local directory | `qwenaudio skill install ./my-skill --skill my-skill` |

For multi-skill repositories `--skill` is required (repeat it to install
several); run `--list` first to see what a source provides. Installing an
entire large catalog at once is intentionally not supported — every skill
description is injected into backend system prompts.

Skills land in the backend CLI's own user-level directory when that backend
declares a skills.sh installer (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.qwen/skills/`,
`~/.openclaw/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, …), so they also work when you use
those CLIs directly, and the desktop app and CLI share the same skills. MiniMax
Code manages its own Skill/Plugin storage; `qwenaudio skill` does not write to
that private store.

When you switch to — or newly install — a backend that is missing previously
installed skills, the gateway backfills them synchronously at startup: a
millisecond-level local check against the skills.sh lockfile
(`~/.agents/.skill-lock.json`), and only when something is actually missing a
one-off skills.sh run (a few seconds) before the backend process starts, so
the backend always sees a complete skill set on its first scan. Failures
(for example offline) are logged and never block the voice gateway.

Skills that ship with Qwen Audio Agent itself live in the repository's
`skills/` folder. One example is `media-playback`, which teaches backends to
find Netflix, Spotify and Stremio links for the Gateway media tools. The
gateway copies them at every start, without skills.sh or the network, into
`~/.agents/skills/`, which Oh My Pi (omp), Codex, OpenCode, Kimi Code and
DeepSeek read. It also copies them into the active backend's own folder when
that backend has one (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.pi/agent/skills/`, …). A copy
is rewritten only when the repository version changes, and an older copy in
another backend's folder is refreshed too. A folder of the same name that you
created yourself is never overwritten.

`media-playback` can check with TMDB whether a title streams on Netflix in
your country. To turn that check on, add a TMDB API read access token and your
two-letter country code (ISO 3166-1, for example `US`) to
`~/.config/qwaudio/config.env`:

```bash
TMDB_API_READ_TOKEN=<your TMDB API read access token>
TMDB_WATCH_REGION=<your country code>
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_ACP_FORWARD_ENV=TMDB_API_READ_TOKEN,TMDB_WATCH_REGION
```

Without `TMDB_WATCH_REGION`, the backend asks you which country to check.
The last line is for Oh My Pi (omp) and other generic ACP backends. The
gateway passes a backend only the environment variables its catalog entry
allows, and for generic ACP those are `ACP_*` plus the names listed in
`QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_ACP_FORWARD_ENV`. Other backends do not receive the token,
and the skill then skips the check. The TMDB lookup runs `curl`, so in the
default `native` permission mode the backend may ask you before it runs.

The pinned skills.sh version can be overridden with
`QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_SKILLS_CLI_PACKAGE` (for example `skills@latest`). If a
newly added backend is not yet supported by skills.sh, contribute an agent
definition to its `src/agents.ts` — that is the official extension point.

### When skills take effect

Files are synced immediately, but each backend discovers new skills on its
own schedule:

| Backend | Discovery | New skill visible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code, Qwen Code, Hermes, DeepSeek | Hot reload (watcher or on-demand read) | Immediately, no action needed |
| Qoder | On session start; `/skills reload` inside a native session | Next backend session |
| OpenCode, OpenClaw, Kimi Code, CodeBuddy, Codex | Snapshot at process or session start | After the backend process restarts |

If a newly installed skill is not discovered, [restart the Gateway for your run mode](../operations/gateway.md#applying-configuration-changes)
so the backend reloads its skills.

### Shared backend workspace

All backends now share one default working directory,
`<data-dir>/workspace`, so switching backends continues the same files
seamlessly. Per-backend overrides (for example `OPENCODE_WORKSPACE`)
still isolate a specific backend when set explicitly.
