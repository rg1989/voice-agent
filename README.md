## About This Fork

This repository is a fork of
[QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent](https://github.com/QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent).
The npm package `qwen-audio-agent` installs upstream, and the
[User Guide](https://qwenaudio.github.io/qwen-audio-agent/) documents upstream.
Neither includes the features below.

Run this fork from source. It needs the Node.js and npm versions listed under
Installation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rg1989/voice-agent.git
cd voice-agent
npm ci                              # also builds the WebUI
node cli/bin/qwenaudio.mjs config   # creates config.env; fill in DASHSCOPE_API_KEY
bin/restart                         # starts the Gateway at http://127.0.0.1:3101
```

After that, `make restart` installs packages if the lock file changed, rebuilds the WebUI if
its sources changed, restarts the Gateway and prints the link. `make start` does the same but
leaves a running Gateway alone, and `make build` only builds.

Run the Gateway from the clone. The Settings panel restarts it with
`bin/restart`, which a global install (`npm run install:global`) does not
include. To set up a computer from an exported setup file, use `bin/setup` as
described in "Moving to another computer" under Installation.

### What This Fork Adds

- **WebUI Settings panel**: choose the brain (Claude Code, Codex, Oh My Pi or No agent), the working folder, the voice and the options below. Oh My Pi (listed when `omp` is installed) uses the provider and model set in Oh My Pi, for example a Z.AI coding plan subscription.
- **Header**: a working-folder switcher, session history to open or delete past conversations, and a spend meter that estimates cost from the voice model's token usage.
- **Wake-word listening in the WebUI**: no microphone audio goes to the voice model until a local detector hears Hey Jarvis, Hey Lisa, Hey Megan, Hey Mycroft or GLaDOS.
- **Voices with their own personas**: nine Qwen-Omni Realtime voices, each with a persona that the voice and the brain both use. Settings lets you preview a voice and edit its persona. An optional robotic voice filters the reply audio.
- **Turn-taking tuning**: set how long a pause ends your turn (0.2 to 6 s) and the speech detection threshold.
- **Research goes to the backend Agent**: the voice hands research and questions it cannot answer to the backend Agent, and its own web search is off by default. An optional setting sends only a one-line summary of each result (the backend's `VOICE:` line) to the voice model.
- **Computer control with approval**: the Gateway asks before the backend Agent uses your screen, mouse or keyboard, once per task by default. Settings can also ask every time, never ask, or turn computer control off.
- **One-command setup on another computer**: see "Moving to another computer" under Installation.
- **Helper scripts**: `bin/brain [claude|codex|omp|none]`, `bin/voice [name]` and `bin/folder [/path/to/project]` set the brain, voice and working folder, then restart the Gateway. Without an argument, they show the current value. `bin/restart` restarts the Gateway.

For WebUI details, see the [WebUI guide](docs/getting-started/webui.md). For
environment variables, see the [configuration guide](docs/configuration.md).

## Agent Presence

Real conversation should not leave you waiting after a single sentence, nor
should it grind to a halt just because the Agent is looking something up,
calling a tool, or working on a task.

Conversation should keep flowing, and the Agent should always be present.

That is why we built **qwen-audio-agent**—a realtime voice runtime that keeps
Agents talking, working, and present. Whether chatting with you, thinking
through a problem, or working on a task, your Agent remains in the
conversation. It listens, responds, and when the task is complete, naturally
tells you:

"It's ready."

## Conversation Continues, Tasks Too

Conversation doesn't stop for background tasks; when a task completes, the
result naturally returns to the current conversation:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab570531-8da9-4af4-93fa-244bb6614c05

### Core Features

- Full-duplex realtime voice interaction, natural interruption, and sustained multi-turn conversation
- One-click integration with your preferred Agent, reusing its model configuration, tools, MCP, Skills, and authentication
- Frontend conversation and background tasks run in parallel; ask about progress or cancel at any time
- Create multiple independent tasks executed asynchronously by the backend Agent, with continuous status tracking
- Task results automatically return to the current conversation, supporting follow-up questions and modifications
- WebUI, terminal TUI, and desktop floating orb (macOS / Windows / Linux)
- Long-term per-user personalization and memory, with an optional VoiceMem connector

## Architecture

![qwen-audio-agent architecture](docs/architecture-overview-en.png)

Questions that can be answered directly are answered immediately; when tools
or sustained processing are needed, the task is delegated to the backend Agent.
Throughout, the user always faces the same assistant.

## Installation

Requires Node.js 22.22.2+ or 24.15.0+, npm 10+. One-click install (recommended):

```bash
npm install -g qwen-audio-agent
```

This command installs upstream qwen-audio-agent without this fork's features.
To run this fork, install it from source as shown in "About This Fork" above.

For building from source, installing from GitHub, and obtaining a DashScope
API Key, see the [installation guide](docs/getting-started/install.md).

### Moving to another computer

To set up a second machine (macOS 13+ or Linux with glibc 2.28+, Intel or ARM)
with the same keys and settings, export them once on the machine that already
works:

```bash
node bin/setup-bundle.mjs export
```

This asks for a passphrase and writes an encrypted
`~/Desktop/voice-agent-setup.qwsetup` with the gateway config (API keys, voice,
brain, settings), the default persona (`ASSISTANT.md`) and memory notes, and
Oh My Pi's providers, logins and skills. Copy it to the other machine (USB stick, `scp`, or
a cloud drive with the passphrase sent separately), then run from a clone of
this repo there:

```bash
bin/setup ~/voice-agent-setup.qwsetup
```

or without a clone:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rg1989/voice-agent/main/bin/setup | bash -s -- ~/voice-agent-setup.qwsetup
```

It installs Node, Bun and Oh My Pi for your user. It also installs the tools that
voice media playback uses: `yt-dlp` and `deno`, plus `playerctl` on Linux and
`media-control` on macOS (from Homebrew; without Homebrew, install it and run
setup again). Then it restores the setup file, builds the desktop app, starts the
gateway at http://127.0.0.1:3101 and opens the app instead of the web page. Setup
asks for your password only when Linux packages such as `curl`, `tar` or `unzip`
are missing (`apt-get`, `dnf`, or `pacman` on Arch and Omarchy); the `curl` form
above needs `curl` first.

Where things go:

- macOS: `~/Applications/Qwen Audio Agent.app`, opened at login by
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.qwen-audio-agent.desktop.plist`. macOS does not let
  a login item read `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop`, `~/Downloads` or iCloud Drive, so
  setup adds the login item only when the checkout is outside those folders (for
  example `QWAUDIO_DIR=~/qwen-audio-agent`). Otherwise it prints a note and skips it.
- Linux: the app in `~/.local/opt/qwen-audio-agent`, a launcher entry in
  `~/.local/share/applications/qwen-audio-agent.desktop` and the command
  `~/.local/bin/qwen-audio-agent`.
- Hyprland (Omarchy): window rules for the orb and the media player go in
  `~/.config/hypr/qwaudio.lua` (`qwaudio.conf` if you use `hyprland.conf`). One
  added line in your Hyprland config loads that file, and it also opens the app
  at login.
- Other Linux desktops: the app opens at login from
  `~/.config/autostart/qwen-audio-agent.desktop`.
- `QWAUDIO_STATE_DIR` in `~/.config/qwaudio/config.env`: the gateway that
  `bin/restart` starts and the desktop app share one state folder, so there is
  only ever one gateway. Do not also run `qwenaudio gateway install`: its
  background service would compete with `bin/restart` for the gateway port.

Open the app again with `bin/desktop` (it starts the gateway first when needed),
or restart only the gateway with `bin/restart`. `QWAUDIO_SETUP_DRY_RUN=1 bin/setup`
prints what setup would install, write or start, and changes nothing.
`QWAUDIO_SETUP_NO_DESKTOP=1` installs without the desktop app and opens the web
page instead. To stop the app from opening at login, delete the LaunchAgent or
autostart file, or the `hyprland.start` block (or the `exec-once` line) in the
Hyprland rules file. Running setup again adds it back.

Conversation history, edits to per-voice personas and the Claude Code login do
not move; run `claude` once if you use it as the brain. Computer control needs
macOS 14+, or on Linux a desktop session with AT-SPI accessibility.

## Quick Start

1. Create your config and fill in the API Key:

```bash
qwenaudio config
```

```dotenv
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your-key
# Voice frontend model: Audio Flash/Plus or Omni Flash/Plus (Audio Plus is default)
QWEN_AUDIO_REALTIME_MODEL=qwen-audio-3.0-realtime-plus
# Backend Agent: optional, leave empty or set to none for frontend-only mode
AGENT_PROTOCOL=openclaw
# Backend model: optional; explicit values use standard ACP, empty reuses Agent config
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_MODEL=qwen3.7-max
```

Before starting, create a key from the [Bailian API Key page](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/?tab=model#/api-key).
Eligible new users can review the [new-user free quota](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/new-free-quota)
and check remaining usage on the [model usage page](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/model-usage-statistics).
Quota and billing rules are subject to the current official Bailian documentation.

> Uses DashScope realtime voice by default. Alternatives include
> [Speech-to-Speech](docs/voice-frontends/speech-to-speech.md) and
> [ModelBest MiniCPM-o 4.5](docs/voice-frontends/minicpm-o.md), with local or hosted endpoints
> selected through their service URL.

With a visual-capable Realtime frontend, WebUI can explicitly stream bounded
camera frames alongside live audio. See [Realtime frontend configuration](docs/configuration/frontend.md).

2. Start the Gateway, then open another terminal to start the TUI (or use `qwenaudio webui` for the browser UI):

```bash
qwenaudio        # Terminal 1: Gateway
qwenaudio tui    # Terminal 2: TUI
```

For full configuration options, local voice frontend setup, and TUI platform
notes, see [quick start](docs/getting-started/quickstart.md),
[voice frontends](docs/configuration/frontend.md), and
[TUI notes](docs/getting-started/tui.md).

## Desktop App

The desktop app provides a persistent floating voice orb with a built-in
Gateway, automatic idle sleep, local voice wake, and customizable appearance.
Download the installer for your platform from the releases page, or build from
source:

```bash
npm run desktop:build:local      # macOS
npm run desktop:build:win        # Windows
npm run desktop:build:linux      # Linux (AppImage + deb, no signing)
```

For visuals, orb behavior, and build instructions, see the
[desktop documentation](docs/desktop/overview.md).

## Examples and Scenario Expansion

The current qwen-audio-agent framework focuses on desktop productivity: users
can keep talking with the Agent in realtime while delegating tool use, file
work, code changes, and long-running tasks to the backend Agent.

This "foreground conversation + background task" design is not limited to
desktop use. It can also expand to more scenarios where the Agent can both
chat naturally and get real work done.

| Scenario | Description | Link | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop | Voice chat, progress follow-up, tools, and background tasks. | [Docs][desktop-docs] | Available |
| Smart cockpit | Vehicle control, navigation, music, weather, and services. | [Example][smart-cockpit-example] | Available |
| AI Passport | Qwen Voice Bean on a hardware card; voice conversation and backend tasks through a LAN relay. Currently half-duplex only. | [Example][ai-passport-example] | Experimental |
| VoiceMem | Optional semantic memory with transcript or native-audio input. | [Setup example][voicemem-example] | Available |
| LightRAG | Replaceable knowledge base with semantic retrieval, document indexing, and management. | [Integration example][lightrag-example] | Available |
| Customer support | Issue clarification, order lookup, tickets, and human handoff. | TBD | Planned |
| Embodied intelligence | Voice commands, action execution, inspection, and exception feedback. | TBD | Planned |
| Livestream assistant | Audience interaction, product explanation, coupons, and risk reminders. | TBD | Exploratory |

This repository includes a smart-cockpit reference scenario built on the
foreground-conversation and backend-execution boundary. Its cockpit UI, small
A2A Agent, and cockpit service are customer-replaceable examples:

```bash
cp examples/smart-cockpit/.env.example examples/smart-cockpit/.env.local
npm run example:smart-cockpit:install
npm run example:smart-cockpit          # service + agent + gateway + client
```

See [examples/smart-cockpit](https://github.com/QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent/tree/main/examples/smart-cockpit) for details.

The [VoiceMem setup example](https://github.com/QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent/tree/main/examples/voicemem)
shows how to install VoiceMem outside the framework, configure the connector, and switch between
Realtime transcripts and VoiceMem-native audio. Lightweight Markdown memory remains the default;
the core npm package contains no VoiceMem Python code or dependencies.

The [LightRAG integration example](https://github.com/QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent/tree/main/examples/lightrag)
connects an independently deployed knowledge base through the generic `KnowledgeProvider`.
LightRAG keeps control of its LLM, embeddings, documents, and indexes; the core npm package does
not include LightRAG or Python dependencies.
