# Qwen Audio Agent Smart Cockpit Example

English | [中文](README_ZH.md)

This runnable smart-cockpit Agent example is built with qwen-audio-agent. Users
can naturally control the vehicle, plan routes, play music, check the weather,
place flash-buy orders, and run custom workflows while the cockpit UI reflects
vehicle and task state. It shows how to combine foreground realtime conversation,
tool calling, and a replaceable backend Agent with the framework.

## Demo

Use natural voice to start vehicle-control and navigation tasks, showing how
realtime foreground conversation, backend Agent execution, and cockpit UI state
work together.

## Architecture

![Smart cockpit framework architecture](docs/framework-architecture.svg)

The base qwen-audio-agent boundary is foreground conversation plus backend
execution. The cockpit client and Gateway form the foreground, the cockpit
Agent handles backend tasks, and the Service supplies scenario state, business
rules, and the tool execution environment.

See the [architecture document](docs/architecture.md) for complete boundaries
and data flows.

## Benchmark Results

The benchmark evaluates cockpit tool calling with the same tools, prompt,
deterministic state, and scorer for Text and Realtime models.

### Short Suite

86 canonical cases across vehicle control, music, navigation, and weather.

| Domain | Cases | Expected calls | Text pass rate | Text actual calls | Realtime pass rate | Realtime actual calls |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Vehicle | 24 | 23 | 100.00% | 23 | 100.00% | 23 |
| Music | 18 | 17 | 100.00% | 17 | 100.00% | 17 |
| Navigation | 36 | 44 | 100.00% | 44 | 97.22% | 44 |
| Weather | 8 | 8 | 100.00% | 8 | 100.00% | 8 |
| Overall | 86 | 92 | 100.00% | 92 | 98.84% | 92 |

### Long-Context Suite

10 mixed-domain conversations, 500 total turns, 250 expected tool calls, and
250 no-tool chitchat/background turns. Long-context results focus on call-level,
state, and no-tool behavior instead of task pass rate.

| Model | Calls exp/act | Tool acc | Aligned tool | Arg acc | Aligned arg | Missing/extra | Final state | Checkpoints | Silent turns |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Text `qwen3.8-flash` | 250 / 252 | 88.80% | 100.00% | 91.20% | 100.00% | 0 / 2 | 100.00% | 100.00% | 90.00% |
| Realtime `qwen-audio-3.0-realtime-plus` | 250 / 246 | 71.20% | 98.40% | 76.00% | 98.40% | 4 / 0 | 100.00% | 80.00% | 100.00% |

See the [Benchmark guide](bench/README.md) for datasets, commands, alignment
metrics, timeout retry behavior, and scoring rules.

## Core features

- **Realtime voice conversation:** continuous dialogue, natural interruption,
  multi-turn context, and runtime voice and persona switching.
- **Standard tool calling:** vehicle control, navigation, music, weather,
  flash-buy, and custom workflows are exposed as MCP tools.
- **Foreground/backend routing:** low-latency operations run directly in the
  foreground Realtime path, including custom-skill creation and loading;
  flash-buy and multi-source news research go to the backend Agent.
- **Standard backend integration:** the example Agent connects through A2A 1.0
  and can be replaced by a customer-owned A2A, ACP, or custom backend.
- **Scenario-state projection:** the cockpit UI receives vehicle, route, music,
  and order state through scenario-owned HTTP/SSE channels.
- **Replaceable components:** the client, backend Agent, and scenario service can
  each be replaced without changing the framework core.

## Interaction paths

- Several foreground tool calls in one model response finish before one combined
  spoken response. Foreground MCP calls default to a 10-second timeout; a failure
  is reported rather than treated as a completed operation.
- Screen route-preference changes silently enter conversation context through a
  scenario event. The assistant can explain the selected preference without
  confusing it with the road the vehicle is actually on.
- Users can save a temperature-reminder rule by voice, then change the climate
  setpoint with the UI `−` / `+` controls. A reminder fires only when the value
  enters the saved range from outside, not repeatedly while it stays inside.
- Memory uses the standard Markdown memory tools and prompt policy; no separate
  cockpit-specific memory protocol is introduced.
- A news-report request runs asynchronously while conversation continues. The
  backend searches and reads sources, returns the full report as an A2A text
  artifact and a short spoken summary, and preserves dates and verification
  limits. Missing evidence is not replaced with model-generated “latest news”.

## Quick start

From the repository root:

```bash
cp examples/smart-cockpit/.env.example examples/smart-cockpit/.env.local
```

Set at least:

```dotenv
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_dashscope_api_key
```

Optionally configure `VITE_AMAP_KEY`, `VITE_AMAP_SECRET`, and `AMAP_MCP_KEY`
for AMap rendering and route services. Then install dependencies and start the
example:

```bash
npm run example:smart-cockpit:install
npm run example:smart-cockpit
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all example processes.

See the [recording checklist (Chinese)](docs/demo-recording.zh.md) for six voice, context, skill, and memory scenarios and their acceptance criteria.

## Tool calling

The cockpit Service provides 38 tools across six scenario domains. Tool
definitions, executors, and foreground/backend routing remain independent.

| Domain | Count | Example capabilities |
|---|---:|---|
| `vehicle` | 11 | Vehicle location and state, climate, windows, sunroof, lights, charging, and other controls. |
| `navigation` | 12 | Place search, routing, ordered waypoints, favorites, route preferences, and stop-navigation. |
| `music` | 10 | Search and playback, previous/next track, volume, media source, and favorites. |
| `weather` | 1 | City weather lookup. |
| `flashbuy` | 1 | Flash-buy product search and ordering demonstration. |
| `custom-skills` | 3 | List, create/update, and load user workflows or structured temperature-reminder rules. |
| **Total** | **38** | Foreground low-latency operations and backend composed tasks. |

The Realtime model sees the function-tool surface assembled by the Gateway:
the foreground MCP tools above, Gateway built-ins, and capability-gated tools.

| Function tool source | Count | Tools |
|---|---:|---|
| Gateway built-ins, default | 8 | `spawn_thinking`, `schedule_reminder`, `cancel_agent_task`, `get_agent_task_status`, `get_current_time`, `memory`, `notes`, `ignore_input` |
| Gateway built-ins, conditional | up to +8 | `knowledge`, `recall`, `respond_permission`, `respond_agent_input`, `web_search`, `fetch_url`, `enter_sleep`, `stop_listening`; visible only when the matching knowledge, session digest, retrieval, pending permission, pending input, client sleep action or wake-word listening capability exists |
| Cockpit foreground MCP tools | 37 | `vehicle`, `navigation`, `music`, `weather`, and the 3 `custom-skills` tools; model-visible names are `mcp__cockpit__*` |
| **Default Realtime base total** | **45** | 8 Gateway built-ins + 37 cockpit foreground MCP tools, before conditional tools |

By default, `vehicle`, `navigation`, `music`, `weather`, and `custom-skills` use
the foreground Realtime path; only `flashbuy` uses the backend Service surface.
The foreground loads workflows and executes their foreground steps directly,
delegating only steps that need backend capabilities. Change domain routing in
[`surface-routing.json`](service/tools/surface-routing.json); see the
[tool directory guide](service/tools/README.md) for extension details.

The backend Agent additionally composes the framework's `web_search` and
`fetch_url` through `qwen-audio-agent/web-retrieval`: 1 Service tool + 2 retrieval
tools by default. These two retrieval tools are not part of the 38 scenario
tools. Search uses the same provider configuration as the frontend; the default
keyless search is an experimental fallback, so verify provider access before a
live demo. See [web-search configuration](../../docs/guides/web-search.md).

## Replace and extend

| Goal | Change |
|---|---|
| Replace the cockpit UI or audio I/O | [`client/`](client/) |
| Replace the backend Agent | Change `COCKPIT_AGENT_CARD_URL` or replace [`agent/`](agent/) |
| Add scenario tools, state, or external services | [`service/`](service/) and [`service/tools/`](service/tools/) |
| Change foreground personas or backend-task semantics | [`gateway/`](gateway/) |
| Change foreground/backend tool routing | [`surface-routing.json`](service/tools/surface-routing.json) |
